      * Finding the months exist on Mars.

      * Finding  the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
        Plot the results as a bar chart

      * Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
        Plot the results as a bar chart.

      * Finding how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year.
